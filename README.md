### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Corrie, a bootcamp grad who departed the text from a 15-year career in communications and now uses words a little differently to create apps and code that go beyond the page.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a bird app that helps users get a list of likely birds at their location using the time of day they plan on heading out. It's an idea I want to flesh out and help me learn React.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to flex my new-found coding muscles and keep building!

Follow my [Work Journal](https://gist.github.com/corrieleech) for more updates about what I'm up to. Learning in public!
